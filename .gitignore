# Doxyfile generated by CMake Configuration
# Because we include doxygen-is-awesome we need to render the Doxygen file each time CMake is run. Thus, the base Doxyfile must become a generated file during CMake configuration.
# To modify the Doxyfile, edit docs/Doxyfile.in and re-run CMake. It will build the new Doxyfile at the root of the build tree.
